## Skills

Visual Scripting

## I'm Getting off the Bus!

As was an option the last two weeks, students who have had their fill of Unity can do some research and writing this week instead of the coding below. 

Apply "affect theory," as described in Anable. Think about twee feels, vibes, and cathexis in one of the games we played this term. Or go to Anna Antropy's main game page at itch.io and play one of her more playful, dirty games and report on your queerer gaming experiences.

## I'm Staying on the Bus!

Proceed as per usual below...

## Level

The Learning Units each have a set of instructions. In most you are both fixing the Scene as well as one or two Script Graphs. 

You are NOT writing any scripts for this week.

## Bosses

### Bowser

Create a simple block moving puzzle using Script Graphs. The puzzle can use any mechanic you choose; feel free to re-use scripts from the level. 

### Hornet

Explore State Graphs and State Machines https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visualscripting@1.8/manual/vs-graph-types.html

Create a puzzle that has multiple states. 

### Demon of Hatred

Do the Demon of Hatred boss challenge from Week 4, but with Script and State Graphs: https://github.com/LiteraryGames/Week-4---Behaviors
